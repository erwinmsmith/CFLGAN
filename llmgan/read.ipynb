To compare naturopathic therapy with conventional medical therapy for treatment of selected menopausal symptoms. A retrospective cohort study, using abstracted data from medical charts. One natural medicine and six conventional medical clinics at Community Health Centers of King County, Washington, from November 1, 1996, through July 31, 1998. Women aged 40 years of age or more with a diagnosis of menopausal symptoms documented by a naturopathic or conventional physician. Improvement in selected menopausal symptoms. In univariate analyses, patients treated with naturopathy for menopausal symptoms reported higher monthly incomes ($1848.00 versus $853.60), were less likely to be smokers (11.4% versus 41.9%), exercised more frequently, and reported higher frequencies of decreased energy (41.8% versus 24.4%), insomnia (57.0% versus 33.1%), and hot flashes (69.6% versus 55.6%) at baseline than those who received conventional treatment. In multivariate analyses, patients treated with naturopathy were approximately seven times more likely than conventionally treated patients to report improvement for insomnia (odds ratio [OR], 6.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71, 26.63) and decreased energy (OR, 6.55; 95% CI, 0.96, 44.74).

      "  \"instruction\": \"Answer the question based on the following context: To estimate the feasibility, utility and resource implications of electronically captured routine data for health technology assessment by randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and to recommend how routinely collected data could be made more effective for this purpose. Four health technology assessments that involved patients under care at five district general hospitals in the UK using four conditions from distinct classical specialties: inflammatory bowel disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, female urinary incontinence, and total knee replacement. Patient-identifiable, electronically stored routine data were sought from the administration and clinical database to provide the routine data. Four RCTs were replicated using routine data in place of the data already collected for the specific purpose of the assessments. This was done by modelling the research process from conception to final writing up and substituting routine for designed data activities at appropriate points. This allowed a direct comparison to be made of the costs and outcomes of the two approaches to health technology assessment. The trial designs were a two-centre randomised trial of outpatient follow-up; a single-centre randomised trial of two investigation techniques; a three-centre randomised trial of two surgical operations; and a single-centre randomised trial of perioperative anaesthetic intervention. Generally two-thirds of the research questions posed by health technology assessment through RCTs could be answered using routinely collected data. Where these questions required analysis of NHS resource use, data could usually be identified. Clinical effectiveness could also be judged, using proxy measures for quality of life, provided clinical symptoms and signs were collected in sufficient detail. Patient and professional preferences could not be identified from routine data but could be collected routinely by adapting existing instruments. Routine data were found potentially to be cheaper to extract and analyse than designed data, and they also facilitate recruitment as well as have the potential to identify patient outcomes captured in remote systems that may be missed in designed data collection. The study confirmed previous evidence that the validity of routinely collected data is suspect, particularly in systems that are not under clinical and professional control. Potential difficulties were also found in identifying, accessing and extracting data, as well as in the lack of uniformity in data structures, coding systems and definitions.\",\n",

The cost of data collection and analysis is likely to fall, although further work is required to improve the validity of routine data, particularly in central returns.

Routinely captured clinical data have real potential to measure patient outcomes, particularly if the detail and precision of the data could be improved.\"\n",

Most previous studies of this relationship have been uncontrolled, and little is known regarding other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) after gastroenteritis. The primary aim of this study was to determine the frequency of IBS, functional dyspepsia, or functional diarrhea 6 months after bacterial gastroenteritis. This was a prospective, community-based, case-control study. Cases had proven bacterial gastroenteritis, and controls were community-based. FGIDs were diagnosed with the use of self-completed Rome II modular questionnaires administered at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Subjects with prior FGIDs were excluded. The primary endpoint was the presence of one of the three specific FGIDs at 6 months. A total of 500 cases and 705 controls were identified. Of the 500 cases, 265 (53%) consented, but only 128 cases and 219 community controls who consented were eligible. At 6 months, 108 cases and 206 controls returned the questionnaire.

Patients admitted for hematochezia and receiving a diagnosis of diverticular hemorrhage were identified using the Mayo Clinic GI Bleeding Team and Emergency Room Admissions Databases for the years 1998-2000. Timing of colonoscopy was determined from the time of admission. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess whether the timing of colonoscopy was associated with an endoscopic finding of active bleeding or nonbleeding stigmata (or both). A diagnosis of definitive or presumptive diverticular bleeding was made in 78 patients (39 men and 39 women, mean age 78 yr, range 49-96 yr). Twelve patients (15%) had active bleeding or stigmata.
